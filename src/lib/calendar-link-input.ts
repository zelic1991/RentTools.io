/** Validation for host-supplied calendar-link fields.
 *
 *  Both values arrive as free text pasted from another platform's UI, and
 *  neither used to be checked at the API boundary. The costs showed up
 *  much later and far from the cause:
 *
 *    * A URL with no scheme stored fine and then failed on every sync
 *      forever with "Failed to parse URL from <host>" — one such row had
 *      accumulated failures for weeks before anyone noticed.
 *    * A platform outside a stale ["airbnb","booking"] allowlist was
 *      rejected with a 400 the UI never displayed, so hosts adding Vrbo /
 *      Rentalia / HomeToGo feeds just saw the dialog vanish.
 *
 *  Keeping both rules here means the POST and PATCH routes agree, and the
 *  messages are written to be shown to the host verbatim.
