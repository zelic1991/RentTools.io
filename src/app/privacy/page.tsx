              question, data request, or complaint is:

              Under the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the UK GDPR,{" "}
              {OPERATOR_NAME} is the data controller for the personal data described in

            <p>We collect only the minimum necessary to operate the Service.</p>
            <p className="mt-3 font-medium text-[var(--ink)]">(a) Account data</p>
            <p>
              Username and password (stored as a bcrypt hash; the plain-text password is
              never written to disk or logs). Account creation timestamp, last login
              timestamp, role (owner / cleaner / admin), and — if you choose to provide
              one — an optional support email address. We do not require an email at
              signup.

            <p className="mt-3 font-medium text-[var(--ink)]">(b) Service data you create</p>
            <p>
              Properties, reservations, calendar links, message templates, cleaning
              records, and any notes or tags you add. iCal feed URLs you connect to
              external platforms (Airbnb, Booking.com) and the events those feeds return.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-3 font-medium text-[var(--ink)]">(c) Operational data</p>
            <p>
              Server-side request logs containing a redacted path, HTTP status, response time, IP
              address, and authenticated user ID. Secure guest-form tokens are removed from logged paths. Application error reports captured by
              Sentry (see section 4). Calendar sync logs per property. Audit logs of
              create/update/delete actions on your own resources. Operational data is
              retained for up to 30 days to debug incidents and detect abuse.

            <p>
              When you upload a passport photo for OCR, the image is transmitted to Google
              Gemini for one-time field extraction (full name, date of birth, document
              number, country, document type, expiry date). The extracted fields are
              attached to the relevant reservation in your account. The original photo is
              not retained on our servers after extraction completes.

              The application server is in the European Union. Sentry, Google Gemini,

              the United States. Where personal data is transferred outside the EEA / UK,
              we rely on the European Commission&apos;s Standard Contractual Clauses
              and the Data Privacy Framework adequacy decisions (where applicable) as the
              transfer mechanism, and on the providers&apos; contractual commitments to

              We may update this Policy when the Service changes or when laws change.
              Material updates will be flagged inside the app and dated at the top of
              this page. Continued use after changes go live means you accept the
              updated Policy. Past versions are available in the public Git history of
              the open-source repository.
