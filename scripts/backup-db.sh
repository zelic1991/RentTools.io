#!/bin/bash
# rent-tool — daily SQLite backup with tiered retention.
#
# Uses sqlite3's online ".backup" command (not cp) to take a
# transactionally-consistent snapshot even while the app is writing.
#
# Layout:
#   /home/app/backups/
#     daily/   — last 7 nightly snapshots
#     weekly/  — last 4 Sunday snapshots (hardlinked into daily/)
#     monthly/ — last 3 first-of-month snapshots (hardlinked into daily/)
#     latest -> daily/prod-YYYYMMDD-HHMM.db   (symlink for easy access)
#
# Hardlinks across tiers mean rotation in `daily/` doesn't actually free
# disk space if the same backup is also referenced from weekly/monthly —
# the inode stays alive until ALL references are removed. The compact
# single-property profile keeps at most ~7 + 4 + 3 = 14 distinct snapshots.
#
# Wired up by deploy/cron/rent-tool.cron at 03:15 every day.
#
# Restore procedure: see docs/DROPLET-SETUP.md §7.
