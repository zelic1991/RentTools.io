# rent-tool — monthly backup-restore drill (RT-21.8).
#
# A backup you've never restored is a guess, not a backup. This script
# proves the latest snapshot at $DEST/latest is actually restorable: copy
# it to a throwaway file, run PRAGMA integrity_check, count rows in the
# core tables, compare against the live DB, alert on any mismatch.
#
# Wired up by deploy/cron/rent-tool.cron on the 1st of every month.
# Alerts via the same Telegram / webhook channel as check-resources.sh
# so the maintainer hears about a failure within a day.
#
# Exit codes: 0 = drill passed (or no backup yet — informational).
#             Non-zero is reserved; we always exit 0 so cron doesn't
#             treat a backup problem as "command failed" and email-spam.
#             The log line + alert side-channel is the report.

# install hasn't pushed all migrations yet), `count_rows` returns "?"
